# Evolving Healthcare Standards under the New Pact on Migration and Asylum

## Updated Healthcare Standards in the New EU Pact

Under the EU’s New Pact on Migration and Asylum, several legislative reforms (including a revised **Reception Conditions Directive (RCD)** and **Asylum Procedure Regulation (APR)**) upgrade the minimum healthcare standards for asylum seekers. These new rules strengthen and harmonize what Member States must provide, compared to the earlier Common European Asylum System (CEAS) requirements. Key improvements include:

* **From Emergency-Only to Comprehensive Healthcare:** The revised RCD entitles asylum applicants to *primary and secondary healthcare*, including specialized services. In particular, Member States must now provide not just emergency care, but full access to **general medical care, specialist treatment, and hospital services**, on par with basic national healthcare. This is a significant expansion from the previous CEAS standard, which only required “emergency care and essential treatment of illness and serious mental disorders” as a minimum. For example, the new RCD’s Article 16 guarantees that all applicants receive necessary **primary and secondary health care, including mental as well as sexual and reproductive health care**. By contrast, the 2013 RCD had left many countries legally limiting asylum-seekers’ care to urgent interventions. (Indeed, before these reforms, almost half of EU countries restricted asylum healthcare to emergencies only.) The Pact’s emphasis on **equivalent reception standards** means health services can no longer be withheld beyond emergency care.

* **Mental Health Services as a Core Obligation:** The new standards explicitly integrate mental health support into asylum reception. Under the revised RCD, psychological care is not an optional add-on but part of the guaranteed healthcare package. The law now specifies that mental health care (including trauma counseling and psychiatric support) must be provided as needed. Previously, CEAS rules were vaguer – mental health was only mentioned in the context of treating “serious mental disorders” or caring for torture survivors. The New Pact closes this gap by treating **mental health and psychosocial support as essential healthcare**. EU institutions have underscored this change; for instance, in the provisional RCD deal, Parliament noted that applicants would be entitled to full **mental health services** and that reception conditions should ensure “an adequate standard of living” including healthcare. The importance of mental health has been echoed in recent EU discussions – there is growing recognition that many asylum seekers suffer trauma, and the Pact seeks to guarantee appropriate care for their well-being.

* **Enhanced Protections for Vulnerable Persons:** The New Pact places special focus on **vulnerable asylum seekers** – such as children, victims of torture or gender-based violence, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, etc. Building on existing CEAS safeguards, the updated rules broaden definitions and require earlier intervention. For example, the revised RCD adds explicit categories like *survivors of sexual or gender-based violence (including female genital mutilation or forced marriage)* as persons with special reception needs. Member States must conduct a **vulnerability assessment within 30 days** of an application to identify any special health or support needs – a much stricter timeframe than under the old directive (which had only a vague “reasonable period” guideline). Once identified, vulnerable individuals must receive tailored care (e.g. trauma counseling, rehabilitation services) *as early as possible*. The APR complements this by **exempting especially vulnerable applicants from accelerated or border procedures** if adequate support cannot be provided in those fast-track settings. In practice, this means, for instance, **unaccompanied minors** and torture victims should not be kept in hasty border camps without care; they should be channeled to normal procedures where full medical and psychological support is available. The New Pact thus operationalizes vulnerability: it requires authorities to **identify and accommodate special needs** in reception and procedures, whereas previously such safeguards were inconsistently applied. Notably, the new RCD mandates that **asylum-seeking children** receive the *same healthcare as national minors* – a clear upgrade from prior standards – and that every unaccompanied child be assigned a guardian to ensure their well-being.

* **Initial Health Screening for New Arrivals:** Another innovation is the introduction of an EU-wide *Screening* at entry, which includes a **mandatory health check**. Under the Pact’s Screening Regulation, all migrants and asylum seekers arriving irregularly are promptly screened for health issues (alongside identity and security checks). This means early detection of communicable diseases or urgent medical needs, as well as flagging vulnerabilities (physical or mental) from the start. Previously, health screening was not uniformly required – some states did it, others did not, leading to gaps in early care. Now, **EU law requires health assessments at the border**, helping ensure that asylum seekers receive necessary medical attention (and referral to support services if vulnerable) immediately upon arrival. This also aids public health and facilitates timely treatment or isolation if needed, a lesson reinforced by recent health crises.

Overall, the New Pact’s healthcare provisions mark a **shift from minimum emergency-oriented care to a more holistic and rights-based approach**. They aim to equalize reception conditions across Member States and prevent “asylum shopping” by assuring all countries offer dignified care. Draft positions from EU institutions have consistently stressed that improving healthcare and reception standards is not only a humanitarian obligation but also instrumental to the Pact’s success. For example, the European Parliament’s rapporteur hailed the RCD agreement as *“a breakthrough… ensuring high and consistent reception standards”* so that no asylum applicant is left sleeping on the street without access to services. In summary, under the reformed framework, **asylum seekers in the EU should receive more comprehensive healthcare – including mental health and special care for the vulnerable – than was ever guaranteed under the previous CEAS rules**, reflecting a more integrated approach to health and asylum policy.

## Implementation Challenges for High-Volume Member States

Implementing these upgraded standards poses significant challenges, especially for Member States that receive large numbers of asylum seekers. In countries like **Germany, Spain, Italy, and Greece**, authorities will need to overcome various administrative, financial, logistical, political, and legal hurdles to meet the new healthcare requirements. Below, we identify the primary difficulties each of these states is expected to face in translating the New Pact’s health standards into reality, and categorize each challenge by its nature. (Each challenge is explained along with the national context that gives rise to it.)

### Germany

Germany has a well-developed healthcare system and a long history of receiving asylum seekers, yet it will confront several obstacles in aligning with the Pact’s higher standards:

* **Legal Challenges:** German national law currently **restricts asylum seekers’ healthcare entitlements**, which conflicts with the new EU standards. Under the Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act (AsylbLG), for the first **36 months** of an asylum seeker’s stay, health care is generally limited to treating *acute illnesses or pain* (plus prenatal care). Only after 36 months are asylum seekers allowed the same comprehensive health coverage as citizens on social welfare. This means many cannot access routine or specialist care (including full mental health services) during their initial years in Germany. In fact, a 2024 law extended this limited-care period from 18 to 36 months, aiming to curb benefits – a step in the opposite direction of the new RCD. **Reforming these laws** will be necessary to provide primary and secondary healthcare from day one as the Pact requires. Such legal changes may face resistance or delay domestically, as they touch politically sensitive territory around benefits for migrants.

* **Political Challenges:** Implementing more generous healthcare for asylum seekers could be **politically contentious** in Germany. The public discourse has grown more skeptical about immigration, amid pressures from populist narratives. The recent extension of benefit restrictions indicates a political calculus to avoid “pull factors.” Expanding asylum-seekers’ health rights (e.g. by repealing the 36-month rule) may face opposition from conservative or far-right voices arguing it could encourage more arrivals. The government will have to balance compliance with EU law against domestic political backlash. Ensuring high standards of care “for people who just arrived” could become a flashpoint in public debate, requiring strong messaging that common EU rules leave no choice. Political will and inter-party consensus will be crucial to push through the necessary legal amendments and budgetary commitments.

* **Financial Challenges:** **Funding expanded healthcare access** is a key concern. Providing full healthcare (including specialist and mental health care) to asylum seekers entails higher costs per capita than the previous emergency-only approach. Germany already spends significant resources on its large asylum population; broadening entitlements will increase short-term expenditures by covering treatments, medications, and preventive care that were previously often deferred. Mental health care, for example, can be long-term and resource-intensive (e.g. therapy for trauma survivors). While Germany’s economy is strong, local authorities – who often bear responsibility for healthcare of asylum seekers – may strain under the increased costs unless the federal government or EU funds provide support. There may also be one-off investments needed (for instance, expanding interpretation services or hiring more medical staff for reception centers). Budgeting for these expenses and ensuring **sustainable financing** (potentially tapping into the EU’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for support) will be an ongoing challenge. If not addressed, financial constraints could lead to delays or uneven implementation across German regions.

* **Administrative Challenges:** Germany’s federal structure and current administrative practices pose hurdles to delivering consistent healthcare. **Coordination between federal, state (Länder), and local authorities** will need improvement. Presently, accessing care often involves bureaucracy: many asylum seekers must obtain a paper **healthcare voucher** for each doctor visit unless their state has adopted a liberalized system. This voucher system, run by municipal social offices, is labor-intensive and can delay care; it also leads to **variation by region**, as some states issue insurance cards to asylum seekers while others do not. To meet the new standards, Germany may need to streamline administration – for example, expanding the use of **health insurance cards for asylum applicants** nationwide so they can visit doctors directly. Harmonizing these practices across all Länder is an administrative challenge. Additionally, conducting the required vulnerability assessments within 30 days for every new applicant will require more case-workers or health personnel than some regions currently have. Ensuring that each asylum seeker, regardless of which state they reside in, promptly receives the expanded services (like prompt assignment to a general physician, scheduling of specialist appointments, etc.) will test Germany’s administrative capacity.

* **Logistical and Capacity Challenges:** Even with funding and legal changes, practical capacity issues must be overcome. Germany will need sufficient **healthcare personnel and infrastructure** to serve a large asylum-seeking population with comprehensive care. This includes having enough general practitioners willing to take asylum seekers on their patient rolls, sufficient availability of specialists (e.g. psychologists, psychiatrists, gynecologists) to handle referrals, and adequate clinic/hospital capacity. Certain services – notably **therapy and counseling for trauma** – are already in high demand. Germany faces waiting lists for mental health treatment even for citizens; adding thousands of refugees with PTSD or depression could worsen bottlenecks. There is also the challenge of **language and cultural barriers**: to truly deliver care, interpretation services and cultural mediators are needed at scale. Currently, many doctors speak only German and rely on ad-hoc solutions for interpretation, which impedes effective care. Scaling up interpreter services or multilingual support is a logistical hurdle. Additionally, accommodating the healthcare needs of asylum seekers dispersed in rural areas or small towns (where specialists or translators may be scarce) will require logistical planning (e.g. transportation to city clinics or mobile health units). If these capacity issues aren’t addressed, Germany risks having the new “rights on paper” not translate into real access – for example, an asylum seeker might have the right to therapy but still wait months to get an appointment. Overcoming these gaps will demand administrative creativity and sustained investment in healthcare infrastructure oriented to refugees’ needs.

Notably, the **underlying national constraint** in Germany is the *tension between a traditionally restrictive asylum support law and the new EU mandates*. Germany’s current system was designed to provide frugal benefits to asylum seekers (partly to discourage unfounded claims), resulting in limited healthcare access by law. This legal and policy stance now collides with the EU’s push for higher standards. Furthermore, Germany’s decentralized welfare administration leads to inconsistency – a constraint that will need resolving through either federal policy or consensus among states. Economically, Germany can likely afford the improvements, but it requires shifting budget priorities and overcoming any public reluctance. Politically, implementing the Pact’s health standards in full will test Germany’s commitment to EU solidarity versus domestic skeptics. In summary, Germany’s main challenges stem from **needing to overturn restrictive laws and procedures** and mustering the political and financial capital to treat asylum seekers almost on par with citizens in the healthcare realm.

### Spain

Spain’s situation differs from Germany’s: Spanish law already grants broad health entitlements to asylum seekers, but practical barriers and resource gaps pose challenges. The primary implementation issues for Spain include:

* **Administrative Challenges:** Ensuring that *in practice* all asylum seekers can exercise their right to healthcare is a significant administrative task. By law, Spain provides **full access to the public health system for asylum applicants**, equal to that of nationals. However, in recent years many asylum seekers faced **bureaucratic obstacles** when trying to obtain care. For example, some healthcare providers were unfamiliar with the asylum seeker ID (the “tarjeta roja” or red card) and wrongly turned patients away. Also, local registration requirements have caused issues – asylum seekers must often be registered in a municipality to get a health card, yet some reception centers didn’t facilitate this promptly. The Spanish Commission for Refugees (CEAR) noted in 2024 that **administrative barriers**, such as not being enrolled in the municipal register (padrón), still impede refugees’ access to health services despite their legal rights. Overcoming these issues will require training front-line medical staff about asylum seekers’ rights, simplifying documentation processes, and coordinating between the asylum system and regional health authorities. The government may need to issue clear protocols so that no asylum seeker is denied care due to paperwork confusion. **Streamlining identification and enrollment** (for instance, ensuring every asylum seeker is immediately registered in the national health system upon applying) is an administrative fix needed to meet the Pact’s promises.

* **Logistical and Capacity Challenges:** While Spain’s universal healthcare law for asylum seekers is progressive, the system faces **capacity constraints**, especially with rising numbers of applicants. One challenge is the **lack of specialized services for trauma and torture victims**. Reports highlight that Spain has *no dedicated medical centers* exclusively treating the severe psychological and physical trauma common among refugees from war or torture. As the new standards emphasize mental health and care for vulnerable persons, Spain will need to develop or expand programs to serve these groups (e.g. rehabilitation for torture survivors, or specialized counseling services). Recently, some NGOs have stepped in – as of 2025, three NGOs manage a total of 82 specialized reception places for asylum seekers with mental health needs. However, these numbers are modest relative to need. Scaling up **mental healthcare capacity** (hiring more psychologists, training staff in intercultural psychiatry, possibly creating referral centers for refugees with PTSD) is a logistical hurdle. More broadly, Spain must ensure its health system can absorb additional demand. In peak years (e.g. 2019–2021), Spain saw surges of asylum applications, which put strain on reception and services. Ensuring that clinics and hospitals in high-demand regions (like Madrid, Catalonia, Andalusia) have the bandwidth – interpreters, appointment slots, and medication – for asylum seekers is essential. **Geography** plays a role too: Spain receives asylum seekers not only on the mainland but in enclaves (Ceuta, Melilla) and islands (Canary Islands), where healthcare infrastructure can be limited. Logistically, transferring patients to facilities or deploying medical teams to remote sites (for example, migrant camps in the Canaries) may be required to meet standards uniformly. All of this demands careful planning and resource allocation.

* **Financial Challenges:** Compared to some peers, Spain has more limited fiscal room, and its healthcare system has undergone austerity measures in the past. **Financing the required improvements** – more mental health services, training, and potentially higher patient loads – poses a challenge. While basic healthcare for asylum seekers is already budgeted as part of the national health service (especially after Spain restored free healthcare for all migrants in 2018), additional needs like specialized trauma care, interpretation, or new facilities will require funding. The Spanish government will likely rely on EU funds (AMIF) to support these, but national investment may also be needed. Economic constraints at the regional level could lead to disparities: some autonomous communities might allocate more resources to refugee health than others. The new Pact’s implementation might force a conversation about **uniform funding** or reimbursements so that, for example, frontline regions like the Canary Islands (dealing with many arrivals) are supported in providing healthcare. In short, Spain must ensure that cost factors do not lead to a degradation of service quality; it may need to dedicate more money to refugee health programs or integrate them into broader public health planning.

* **Political Challenges:** In Spain, the political climate regarding migration has been relatively supportive of humanitarian measures in recent years (e.g. the government reversed restrictive healthcare policies and championed integration). However, there is still potential for political friction. The introduction of the new standards could become politicized if opponents frame them as an undue burden. For instance, if waiting times in hospitals are long, some might scapegoat “asylum seekers getting care” – even if numbers show that impact is minimal. Additionally, Spain’s multi-party politics and the influence of anti-immigrant voices (such as the Vox party) could challenge continued generosity. As of the mid-2020s, Spain has navigated this by maintaining a universal approach. To implement the Pact fully, the government will need to **sustain political will** to invest in asylum seeker healthcare and resist any rollback. So far, Spain’s compliance with high standards (like healthcare equality for migrants) has been a point of pride, but any future shift in government could test that commitment. The key underlying constraint here is ensuring that **political commitment remains steady** and that regional governments (who manage health services) all buy into the enhanced standards rather than quietly introducing obstacles.

In summary, Spain’s main hurdles are **practical implementation and capacity** rather than legal entitlement. The country must translate its strong legal framework into consistently accessible care on the ground. That means cutting red tape that blocks access and expanding specialized support for the vulnerable. These challenges stem from national constraints such as a decentralized health system (17 autonomous regions) that can result in patchy application of policies, a general shortage of mental health resources in the public system, and budget limitations. Addressing these will be critical for Spain to meet the New Pact’s promise that an asylum seeker in Spain will receive the same level of care and support as one in any other EU country.

### Italy

Italy faces a mixed set of challenges: its laws promise healthcare to asylum seekers similarly to nationals, but bureaucratic delays and regional disparities undermine delivery. Additionally, Italy’s recent political climate and capacity issues in certain hotspots create implementation difficulties. Key challenges include:

* **Administrative Delays and Complexity:** A primary challenge in Italy is cutting through the **bureaucracy that delays access to care** for asylum seekers. By law, anyone who has lodged an asylum application in Italy can register with the National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) and enjoy full rights like an Italian citizen. In practice, however, many asylum seekers experience long waits before they can actually use the health system. The bottleneck is the **delay in lodging and processing asylum paperwork**. Asylum seekers often must wait weeks or months for their formal application to be registered and for authorities to issue them a tax identification code and residence permit – prerequisites for SSN enrollment. During this period, they are treated as uninsured migrants: they only have a right to *urgent or essential care* under a provision for irregular migrants. This means initial healthcare is effectively limited to emergencies, despite the intent of the law. For example, if an asylum seeker arrives with a chronic condition or needs non-urgent surgery, they might not get it until their papers are processed. The New Pact’s standards (which call for immediate healthcare access, including non-urgent care) will force Italy to **streamline its registration process**. The challenge is largely administrative – ensuring asylum claims are formally lodged faster (the new APR sets tighter deadlines for registration, which may help) and possibly decoupling health access from permit issuance. Italy will need to find ways to **provide health coverage from day one** (perhaps issuing provisional health cards upon initial intent to seek asylum) to comply with the RCD’s spirit. Overhauling bureaucratic procedures across numerous Questure (police immigration offices) is not easy, especially in high-demand regions where backlogs are common. Yet without fixing this, Italy cannot truly say asylum seekers have timely healthcare. Another administrative issue is **documentation continuity** – asylum seekers’ health cards can lapse when their permit is awaiting renewal, causing gaps in care. Managing renewals more efficiently is another needed improvement.

* **Regional Disparities and Logistical Issues:** Italy’s healthcare system is regionally administered, leading to **uneven implementation** of policies for asylum seekers. While the law is national, in practice some regions have set up better support than others. Logistical challenges manifest in several ways. First, **differences in policy**: e.g. co-pay exemptions for asylum seekers (so they don’t pay medical fees) are handled differently – some regions treat asylum seekers as unemployed (exempting them from fees for longer) while others label them “inactive” after 2 months and start charging fees unless they register at job centers. Such inconsistencies can confuse both refugees and providers, and may require standardization under the new rules of equal treatment. Second, **capacity and training gaps**: Many Italian healthcare providers have limited experience or training in refugee health. As noted by legal observers, there is “general misinformation and lack of specific training on international protection” among medical staff. Diseases more common in refugees (tropical diseases, war injuries, psychological trauma) may be unfamiliar to local doctors, and there is often no specialized referral system. The *language barrier* is a huge logistical hurdle: most doctors and nurses speak only Italian, and **interpreters or cultural mediators are rarely available** in hospitals and clinics. As a result, asylum seekers struggle to communicate symptoms or follow instructions, and many avoid going to the doctor until a condition becomes urgent. The new standards demand proactive and accessible care, so Italy must invest in **interpretation services** and cultural mediation to make healthcare truly available. Some regions and NGOs have begun projects (the excerpt notes training programs in certain regions, co-funded by EU, to train healthcare professionals in working with refugees). But scaling this nationwide is a logistical task. Additionally, Italy faces unique challenges in specific locations: *border and disembarkation areas* like Lampedusa, Sicily, or Apulia see sudden influxes of migrants rescued at sea. Reception centers there (and informal encampments in some cities) often had substandard conditions – overcrowding, poor sanitation – which exacerbate health problems. Ensuring **adequate medical presence in first reception hotspots** is critical. For instance, if a large group lands in Lampedusa, Italy must have systems to quickly screen, treat, and if needed transfer serious cases to mainland hospitals. The Pact’s screening regulation formalizes some of this, but the logistics (having enough doctors on call, translation, emergency plans) remain a national responsibility.

* **Financial Challenges:** Implementing the enhanced healthcare standards will have financial implications for Italy. The country must support its under-resourced health system to deliver more services to asylum seekers without sacrificing quality for all patients. Many regions of Italy (especially in the south) have healthcare budgets under strain. **Hiring more mediators, psychologists, and medical staff**, and ensuring availability of medicines and diagnostics for refugees, will require funding. Italy has often leaned on EU funds for migrant-related costs (AMIF, emergency funding), but these may not cover all recurrent health expenses. The government will need to allocate resources to, for example, expand mental health services accessible to asylum seekers (possibly funding NGOs or specialized clinics to handle torture survivors, as some already do under limited capacity). There is also a cost in overhauling administrative systems – e.g. developing an interoperable system to issue health cards faster or to keep them valid through permit renewals. Furthermore, Italy provides health care free of charge to destitute asylum seekers (they self-declare lack of income and are exempt from co-pays). As asylum seekers remain longer in the system (due to slow EU relocations or lengthy asylum procedures), these costs accumulate for regional health services. If the number of asylum seekers rises (as has been the trend in 2023–2024 with more boat arrivals), Italy might face **budgetary pressure in its health sector**. Ensuring that financial constraints do not lead regions to cut corners (for instance, not hiring needed staff for reception centers) is a challenge. In effect, Italy’s ability to implement the Pact’s standards will, to some extent, ride on **solidarity mechanisms** – either EU support or internal burden-sharing – to help cover the increased healthcare expenditures in high-traffic areas.

* **Political Challenges:** Italy’s political climate can be a constraining factor. In recent years, migration has been a polarizing issue, and governments have oscillated in their approach to asylum reception. The current government (as of 2024–2025, led by parties with a more restrictive stance on immigration) may be reluctant to invest heavily in improving conditions for asylum seekers, fearing it could be seen as an inviting signal. Indeed, a few years ago Italy rolled back parts of its reception system – reducing funds for integration services and closing many local reception projects – in the name of deterrence. Reversing that course to meet EU standards might clash with the government’s base messaging. There could be **political resistance to expanding services** like mental health care for asylum seekers, especially if framed negatively by opposition or media. However, the EU Pact obligations will pressure Italy to comply regardless of domestic politics. One political challenge will be convincing local communities to accept enhancements like new health facilities or the presence of asylum seekers in local clinics. Some municipalities have protested the opening of migrant centers or claimed that refugees strain local services. The government will need to ensure that improving healthcare access for asylum seekers is accompanied by clear communication that EU funding and national strategies are in place to support local systems – to mitigate “us vs. them” sentiments. Another political aspect is Italy’s call for more European burden-sharing: Italian leaders might link their willingness to implement high standards with demands for other states to relocate asylum seekers or provide financial help. If they feel abandoned, they may slow-roll implementation. Ultimately, Italy’s compliance might hinge on a mix of EU pressure and domestic political calculus. The underlying constraint here is the **fluctuating political will** – if migration is framed solely as a security issue, investments in humane reception (like healthcare) could be undervalued. The New Pact’s success in Italy may require continued engagement and possibly incentives from Brussels to keep Italian politics aligned with the agreed humanitarian commitments.

In summary, Italy’s challenges spring from *systemic administrative inertia, regional fragmentation, and political ambivalence*. The country does not need to change its laws much – those are already aligned with providing broad care – but it needs to **enforce them uniformly and efficiently**. Long-standing issues like slow bureaucracy and insufficient interpreter support are national constraints that will take concerted effort to overcome. Additionally, Italy’s capacity to meet the standards will depend on strengthening its health services in migrant-heavy areas and ensuring that short-term political agendas do not undercut long-term compliance. The New Pact gives Italy an impetus (and perhaps resources) to address these issues, but it will require Italy to prioritize asylum seeker health in ways it has struggled to previously.

### Greece

Greece is on the frontlines of EU migration and has perhaps the most acute challenges in implementing the new healthcare standards. Over the past decade, Greece’s asylum reception system – especially on the Aegean islands – has been frequently overwhelmed, with dire effects on healthcare provision. The New Pact’s requirements demand significant improvements. The main challenges for Greece fall into the following categories:

* **Administrative Challenges:** One of Greece’s historical struggles is *inefficient administrative processes* that delay or deny asylum seekers access to services. A key example is the issuance of social security/health numbers. In the past, asylum seekers were stuck without Greece’s national insurance number (AMKA), effectively barring them from public health care. Greece addressed this by introducing a **temporary alien health insurance number (PAAYPA)** in 2020, which is supposed to be issued to every asylum applicant upon registration. PAAYPA entitles the holder to free primary, secondary and pharmaceutical care, including psychiatric care. However, the *implementation* saw delays and gaps. Initially there were technical and bureaucratic delays rolling out PAAYPA, and even by 2023 not every asylum seeker had one promptly. For example, in a UNHCR survey of late 2022–2023, about 5% of registered asylum households lacked a PAAYPA number when surveyed. Moreover, **delays in the asylum registration itself** lead to health access delays. In mainland Greece, backlogs mean an asylum seeker might wait weeks to be fully registered (and get PAAYPA). On the islands during surges, it’s been worse: in late 2023 on Kos, initial registration wait times were around 2 months (improved to 35 days by early 2024) – during which *those not yet registered had no access to healthcare*. Such administrative delays are a direct barrier to meeting the Pact’s standards (which assume continuous access to care). Greece will need to **dramatically speed up registration and PAAYPA issuance**, essentially ensuring that every arrival is documented and given healthcare access within days, not months. The new Screening Regulation (which requires health checks in 5 days) may help push this, but the capacity on the ground must be there to implement it. Another administrative issue is maintaining coverage: PAAYPA is tied to the validity of the asylum seeker’s permit/card and can deactivate if an appeal is pending or a permit expires. Ensuring continuity (especially for vulnerable cases or those awaiting transfer) will require administrative attention. In short, Greece’s public administration will be challenged to eliminate the **paperwork bottlenecks** that currently leave asylum seekers in limbo without care.

* **Logistical and Capacity Challenges:** Greece faces severe logistical constraints in providing healthcare to asylum seekers, particularly in the high-volume *“hotspots”* on the Aegean islands (Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Kos, Leros) and in some mainland camps. The Pact’s standards (e.g. requiring timely primary care and mental health support) clash with the reality of **under-resourced medical services in these camps**. Chronic issues include:

  * **Insufficient Medical Personnel:** Many reception facilities have operated with *critically few doctors or none at all*. For instance, the Closed Controlled Access Centre (CCAC) on *Chios had no permanent doctor on-site from March 2021 through at least early 2024*. Similarly, by end of 2023, *Kos’s CCAC had no resident doctor or psychologist*, and Samos CCAC never had a permanent doctor since opening. One doctor would periodically travel from Leros to these islands, but often only to sign off paperwork like vulnerability assessments rather than to treat patients. Such dire staff shortages mean asylum seekers often receive little to no regular medical attention. Meeting the new standards will require **hiring or deploying many more healthcare workers to refugee camps**. Greece’s national health system (ESY), however, has limited capacity and struggled even for the local population, especially after a decade of austerity. The government has relied on contracted NGOs or the Hellenic National Public Health Organization (EODY) programs to fill gaps. Specifically, the **Philos program** (an EU-funded project) deployed doctors and psychologists to camps. But this program has faced instability – contracts for hundreds of staff nearly lapsed in 2023, with workers unpaid for months due to funding process delays. While an extension was granted into 2024 with a plan to replace it with a new “Hippocrates” program, the episode revealed a vulnerability: Greece’s camp healthcare is heavily reliant on **temporary, donor-funded schemes**, and interruptions can leave camps with zero medical staff. Going forward, Greece must establish a more stable, permanent healthcare presence in reception centers – which may mean absorbing some of these roles into its national system or ensuring continuous EU support. Without enough doctors and nurses on the ground, mandates for “necessary health care” remain unfulfilled. This is arguably Greece’s most urgent challenge: **scaling up healthcare human resources in refugee sites**.
  * **Remote and Overburdened Facilities:** Many asylum seekers in Greece are hosted in remote locations – islands or isolated mainland camps – far from hospitals or specialized services. The **geographical isolation** is a logistical nightmare for accessing healthcare. Even with a PAAYPA number, an asylum seeker on, say, Samos faces difficulty seeing a specialist because the island’s medical facilities are limited and the camp is far from town. Transport options are limited or controlled. UNHCR and even the UN High Commissioner have noted that *the remoteness of camps hampers effective access to health and psychosocial support*. To implement the Pact, Greece will need to improve transport arrangements (e.g. shuttle services to hospitals), bring services on-site (through mobile clinics or visiting specialists), or relocate more vulnerable asylum seekers to urban accommodations where services exist. Additionally, when serious cases arise, medical evacuation to the mainland becomes necessary – Greece will need robust referral systems and possibly reserved capacity in mainland hospitals for refugee patients. During crisis peaks, local island clinics were overwhelmed by migrant patients (and at times, locals protested that their clinics were strained). The Pact’s promise that no country be left alone under pressure suggests Greece should receive EU support to address these overload situations. But the immediate logistical constraint is that **the infrastructure in islands and border areas is scant** – building up clinic facilities in camps (for primary care, mental health counseling, etc.) might be required.
  * **Mental Health and Specialized Care Shortages:** Greece faces particular difficulty providing mental health care, which the new standards emphasize. The population in camps includes many **traumatized individuals (war survivors, torture victims)**, yet qualified psychologists or psychiatrists are few. As noted, some camps had no psychologist at all for long periods. NGOs like Médecins Sans Frontières have tried to fill the gap by offering mental health services outside the camps, but capacity is limited. The *Philos* program also included psychosocial workers, but their uncertain status jeopardized continuous care. Meeting the EU standard will require **integrating mental health support** as a core service – meaning at least one psychologist per camp, regular psychiatric consultations for severe cases, and referral pathways to hospitals for complex needs. Considering Greece’s mental health sector is stretched (even Greeks have limited access in some areas), this is a huge challenge. It may require outsourcing to international organizations or significantly boosting funding for mental health in asylum contexts. The underlying constraint is both financial and human-resource: few professionals are willing to work in remote camp conditions at current salaries, and Greece would need either to incentivize them or bring in foreign-trained staff (perhaps via EU support programs).

* **Financial Challenges:** Greece’s ability to implement these changes is tightly constrained by its economic situation. After a financial crisis and strict budget oversight, public services in Greece operate with limited resources. The health system, in particular, underwent cuts and still grapples with shortages for the general population. Thus, **finding funds to improve asylum seeker healthcare** is challenging domestically. Greece has leaned heavily on European funds (AMIF, EU emergency assistance) to run its reception system – the continued dependency is evident in programs like *Philos* being AMIF-funded. If EU funding were to wane or if new needs arise (e.g. building clinic facilities in camps, hiring more staff), Greece would struggle to cover costs from its own budget. Financial uncertainty already caused gaps (e.g. the Philos workers not being paid for September 2023 due to administrative delay in EU fund disbursement). The Pact implementation will require **stable financing mechanisms**. The EU has promised not to leave frontline states alone, so presumably funding will be available. Still, absorption and distribution of funds in Greece can be slow (due to bureaucracy), which is a constraint that needs addressing so that money translates to actual services on the ground. Another financial aspect is that high-volume influxes can suddenly increase costs – e.g. an island may see thousands of new arrivals needing health screening, emergency care, etc. Greece will have to maintain **flexible funding reserves or surge capacity** to handle spikes (like during crisis situations, which the new *Crisis Regulation* anticipates). The country’s fragile finances mean it must continue to rely on European solidarity to meet these standards; the challenge is ensuring that funding is not only allocated but effectively utilized to improve conditions.

* **Political Challenges:** Politically, Greece has in recent years prioritized border control and deterrence over enhancing reception conditions. The government has prided itself on reducing flows (through stricter border enforcement) and speeding up asylum denials/returns, and it has been less vocal about improving camp conditions – often those have improved only under intense external criticism. **Convincing the Greek polity to invest in asylum seeker welfare** could be difficult when the narrative has been about “toughness” on migration. However, there is also political incentive for Greece to comply with EU norms to avoid legal infringements or reputational damage (scenes of squalid camps like Moria in 2020 were a humanitarian and public relations disaster). The New Pact’s requirements give Greek authorities a framework to justify upgrades (“Brussels mandates this”). Still, local politics on islands is tricky: island communities have protested large migrant centers, and any attempt to allocate more resources or build facilities might face local pushback unless coupled with alleviation of migrant numbers. Politically, Greece may press the EU for more relocation of asylum seekers to other countries as a condition or parallel effort – they might argue that they can meet high standards only if numbers are reduced via solidarity. The underlying national constraint is that **public tolerance in Greece for asylum seekers has limits**, especially in regions that bore the brunt of the crisis. If the Pact’s promise of solidarity (relocation, help) doesn’t materialize sufficiently, domestic political will to improve conditions might falter. Another political factor is Greece’s austerity mindset: spending on non-citizens can be sensitive when many Greeks also feel their services are underfunded. The government will need to navigate these optics, perhaps by emphasizing EU funding and the fact that improving health standards in camps also protects public health for all (e.g. treating communicable diseases, preventing camp outbreaks).

In conclusion, Greece’s challenges are the most **fundamental**: it needs to build up capacity nearly from scratch in some areas to meet the Pact’s benchmarks. The national constraints causing these challenges are clear – *an overstretched infrastructure, heavy reliance on external aid, and an administrative system that struggles with volume and speed*. For instance, when MSF reports that even **registered** asylum seekers cannot see a doctor for weeks on Lesvos due to registration delays and staff neglect, it underscores a systemic breakdown that must be fixed if the new standards are to mean anything. To comply, Greece will have to overhaul how it handles health in its asylum system: from expediting registration (so nobody goes unseen for lack of a file), to guaranteeing presence of medical professionals in all facilities, to improving access despite remote locations. These steps will likely require continued EU assistance, technical support (perhaps deploying teams from other Member States via the new EU Asylum Agency), and a sustained commitment by Greece to prioritize the basic rights and dignity of asylum seekers alongside border management. Only by addressing the root constraints – inadequate resources, inefficient bureaucracy, and political reluctance – can Greece successfully implement the New Pact’s healthcare standards.

## Underlying National Constraints and Conclusion

Across Germany, Spain, Italy, and Greece, the effort to implement the New Pact’s healthcare provisions lays bare each country’s **underlying constraints**:

* In **Germany**, the main constraints are *legal and political*: a domestic legal framework intentionally limiting benefits (to deter migration) collides with EU requirements, and political sentiment may resist change. Germany’s federal administrative setup also complicates uniform implementation. Nonetheless, Germany’s strong health system capacity and funding base mean that, with legal reforms and political will, it can meet the standards – essentially by removing self-imposed barriers.

* In **Spain**, the hurdles are mostly *administrative and capacity-related*, reflecting a gap between progressive laws and on-the-ground execution. The constraint here is ensuring that a decentralized system functions coherently – improving training, reducing red tape, and bolstering specialized care. Spain’s relatively supportive political climate and existing universal health law are enablers; the challenge is to operationalize those commitments fully in every region.

* In **Italy**, the constraints are woven into *bureaucracy and regional disparities*, compounded by political ambivalence. Italy’s system shows that even when rights exist on paper, slow processes and fragmentation can negate them. Overcoming Italy’s challenges means tackling inefficiencies (a longstanding Italian governance issue) and ensuring nationwide consistency – tasks often stymied by complex bureaucracy and political turnover. The current government’s priorities will heavily influence the pace of compliance, making political factors a wildcard despite Italy’s capacity as a developed nation.

* In **Greece**, the constraints are largely *structural and resource-based*: an underfunded public sector, an influx far beyond what systems were designed for, and a reliance on emergency responses over sustainable planning. Greece’s challenges highlight that without sufficient doctors, clinics, and funding, even the best-intentioned standards cannot be met. The constraints here are the most elemental – physical absence of services and staff – requiring concerted efforts and external support to overcome.

Each country must address these specific constraints to fulfill the New Pact’s vision of humane and equivalent reception standards. The **common thread** is that the New Pact effectively raises the bar and forces countries to confront long-standing weaknesses in their asylum and healthcare systems. Whether it’s Germany rethinking its restrictive laws, or Greece building basic health infrastructure in camps, these are not minor adjustments but significant reforms.

In conclusion, the evolving healthcare standards under the New Pact represent a substantial leap forward in theory – mandating comprehensive health coverage, mental health care, and special protection for the vulnerable across the EU. Realizing this in practice will require high-volume member states to invest in systems and overcome internal challenges that have historically impeded asylum seeker healthcare. The coming years (up to the transposition/application deadlines in 2026) will test each nation’s ability to adapt. Success will mean asylum seekers, whether in Berlin, Madrid, Rome, or Athens, can access a doctor, receive essential treatments (physical and psychological), and have their particular needs met in a timely manner as European law now envisions. The cited reforms and analyses all underscore a shared premise: **improving healthcare for asylum seekers is not only a legal obligation but also key to upholding human dignity and integrating those who may become new members of society**. The New Pact’s challenge is ensuring that no matter the member state – wealthy or struggling, enthusiastic or reluctant – these higher standards are implemented to the benefit of both asylum seekers and the integrity of the EU asylum system.
