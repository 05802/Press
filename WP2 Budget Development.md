### Key assumptions behind the figures

| Area | Assumption |
| --- | --- |
| **Staff rates** | Mid-scale NGO rates for northern Greece: €140-€200 /day for technical staff, €160 /day for senior trainers, €180 /day for specialised experts. |
| **Trainer fees** | €250 per trainer-day (covers prep, delivery, post-session de-brief). Each 4-hour session counted as one trainer-day to keep calculations simple and conservative. |
| **Participant costs** | Light catering/refreshments + local bus fares averaged at €10 per participant per session. |
| **Interpretation** | Community interpreters engaged locally at €120 per half-day session, no travel or per-diem needed. |
| **Printing** | Digital print on recycled 120 gsm paper; €8 per full-colour, 32-page booklet in runs of 100–200. |
| **Sub-contracted services** | Local freelancers (graphic design, videography, post-production) hired at going regional market rates; no VAT surcharge assumed for small-scale contracts. |
| **Microsite hosting** | Twelve-month package on a Greek VPS including SSL, CDN and maintenance. |
| **Travel** | Day-return bus travel only; no accommodation costs because trainers travel the same day, as per brief. |

### Clarifying questions that could tighten the budget further

1. **Exact staff salaries:** Confirm the daily rates already agreed internally for each staff category; minor changes shift the personnel envelope significantly.
2. **Venue availability:** Are free community venues available in Thessaloniki for the two training days? If so, the (currently waived) €0 line can remain; if a fee becomes unavoidable we must re-allocate inside the cap.
3. **Toolkit print run:** Do stakeholders definitely need 300 hard copies, or could we cut/expand the print quantity?
4. **Translation depth:** Should the toolkit be fully localised (layout per language) or will a single bilingual master suffice? This affects both design and QA costs.
5. **Webinar licence:** Will the partner use an existing corporate Zoom licence (cost absorbed) or must we purchase a new one?
6. **Paid social reach:** Is €1 500 sufficient for the advocacy campaign’s paid reach, or do we target a larger national audience that would need a bigger ad budget?
7. **Overheads:** The Bodossaki form allows a flat indirect‐cost percentage – will the consortium apply it, or keep the budget purely direct as shown here?

Answering these would let us lock numbers and, if needed, rebalance lines without breaking the €54 000 ceiling or the 60 % lead-over-partner rule.
