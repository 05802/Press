**Healthcare Literature Review \- AMIF** 

**Overview**  

The 2025 AMIF Call marks a shift in EU migration policy by prioritising healthcare access as a standalone focus. The call emphasises that legal entitlement alone is insufficient—limited awareness, cultural barriers, and structural inequities remain major obstacles. Key themes include effective and targeted outreach, culturally competent care, mental health support, sexual and reproductive health services, and digital inclusion.

Recent EU policy developments, particularly the 2024 Pact on Migration and Asylum, introduce new minimum standards for healthcare, especially for vulnerable groups such as women, unaccompanied minors, and those affected by trauma. However, the implementation remains uneven across Member States, often constrained by national discretion, inadequate data systems, and fragmented coordination.

Over the past decade, a range of EU- and AMIF-funded initiatives—like MyHealth, MHEALTH4ALL, and EU4Health—have demonstrated the value of community-based, trauma-informed, and gender-sensitive interventions. These efforts also underscore the importance of cultural mediation, multilingual communication, and systemic training for healthcare professionals.

Scholarship points to the need for a holistic and intersectional approach, integrating digital tools with on-the-ground networks, fostering trust, and ensuring sustained collaboration among EU institutions, Member States, NGOs, and migrant communities.

**EU priorities**   
*What is the EU’s approach to migrants’ healthcare, and what elements were emphasised or abandoned in policy outputs?*

Hot topics  \- AMIF Call, 2025

* Effective Outreach and Information Dissemination: Migrants' limited awareness of their healthcare rights is now emphasized as a *primary barrier*—not just legal entitlement.  
* Tailored Communication: Shift from general inclusion to targeted outreach that considers language, digital literacy, cultural sensitivity, and specific needs (e.g. gender, age).  
* Mental Health & Psychosocial Support: Elevated priority due to pandemic effects, trauma related to displacement, and taboos.  
* Sexual and Reproductive Health: Specifically called out, with a focus on migrant women and unaccompanied minors, and the need for better communication and service access.  
* Dissemination of Existing Tools: highlighted a need to scale up proven methods, especially from past EU-funded initiatives, not to reinvent.  
* Keywords: Effective outreach, Informed access, Intersectional barriers, Culturally competent care, Trauma-informed support, Gender-sensitive services, Community-based approaches, System navigation support. 

Related policy areas

* Education: Health literacy, especially for youth and unaccompanied minors, now tied more explicitly to outreach goals.  
* Digital Inclusion: Access to online portals and resources in multiple languages is a key dissemination strategy.  
* Gender Equality: Stronger integration of gendered needs in healthcare policy and access planning.  
* Child Protection: Health access for minors now extends beyond vaccination into preventive and sexual/reproductive health.  
* Migration Governance: Reinforced link to the Pact on Asylum and Migration and newly adopted legal standards (see below).

Key developments   
*How has the EU approach to the topic changed over the past 5 years?*

* In the EU, the scope of healthcare to which third country nationals have access depends on residence or employment status. Access to healthcare can be a key factor determining the outcome of applications for international protection, with subsidiary protection applying, in some cases, if the asylum-seeker contends that a return to the country of origin is impossible for health reasons (European Commission, n.d)  
* The European Commission’s priority is to ‘provide support to countries that host a high number of migrants’. Its concern is centered around deterioration of migrants’ health condition prior or during their travels.   
* Standards related to healthcare have been incorporated in the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) primarily through the Procedures Regulation, Qualifications Regulation and the Receptions Directive.   
* The 2020 Commission Proposal for a New Pact on Migration and Asylum reforming the CEAS addressed healthcare by introducing health checks that will allow an early identification of migrant’s potential needs.   
* Two notable events of the past 5 have impacted healthcare for displaced people in the EU, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the Ukraine invasion in 2022, the latter creating concern particularly around the implementation of the 2001 Temporary protection Directive (European Commission, 2023).   
* In the new Pact adopted in 2024, the Reception Conditions Directive introduces changes that are meant to enhance access to healthcare, by setting minimum standards concerning minors, vulnerable people, crisis response and access to information. Implementation of these standards remain for Member State discretion.  

Overall, looking at the EU’s approach to newcomers’ healthcare over the past years reflects the growing focus on mental health, women, training and sexual health, aligned with the 2025 AMIF call key areas of focus.

Relevant EU policy frameworks \[look for new innovations, and what didn’t work\]

*  [Directive 2011/95/EU (Recast Qualification Directive)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0095): grants access to adequate healthcare, including treatment of mental disorders when needed, to [beneficiaries of international protection](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/pages/glossary/beneficiary-international-protection_en) under the same eligibility conditions as nationals.  
* [Directive 2013/33/EU (Recast Reception Conditions Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32013L0033): establishes minimum standards for access to healthcare for applicants of international protection during the asylum procedure. It requires EU Member States to ensure that asylum seekers at least receive emergency care and essential treatment for illnesses and serious mental disorders. However, the entitlement of asylum seekers to healthcare services remains for Member State discretion.   
* 2016: Commission approved the second package of proposals to reform the Common European Asylum System, including the legislation containing provisions on healthcare such as:  
* [the Asylum Procedures Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=celex:32013L0032)  
* [the Qualifications Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32011L0095)  
* [the Reception Conditions Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32013L0033)  
* The new provisions on access to healthcare for applicants for and beneficiaries of international protection were adopted under the Pact on Asylum and Migration (adopted 2024), namely the revised Reception Conditions Directive and the Qualification Regulation (see section above).

Despite the Pact’s said objective to enhance newcomers’ access to healthcare, scholars suggest that current policies are insufficient for promoting the health of asylum seekers and migrants, not least given the unique health risks they are exposed to in their journeys and upon arrival (Farina et al, 2024). Farina et al have argued that the failure to implement common health policies in the Pact compromises the impact and cost effectiveness of interventions, and thereby access to care. They suggest a shift towards a ‘holistic approach’ to migrant care, including evidence-based policies, EU-wide referral systems, clear guidelines, digital data collection, adequate training for healthcare professionals and educational focus on migrant health. 

Moreover, studies continue to highlight issues related to dissemination of knowledge and guidelines among newcomers. According to Bozogmehr and his colleagues (2023), a key factor contributing to such knowledge gaps is the insufficient quality in European health information systems, producing incomplete coverage of migrant and refugee data. They argue for more systematic data collection and analysis, and emphasise the need to engage migrants and refugees in decisions about their own health data.

**Recent/Existing interventions**   
*What are the things people have tried that we can build on or learn from?*

EU interventions 

Health inequalities addressed by the EU through various projects since 2003, including those affecting migrants (European Commission, n.d). General activities include financial support to improve healthcare for vulnerable migrants; support MS with high levels of migration; coordination activities through the Health Security Committee; work with INGOs; training programmes and training materials. 

Recently, several projects have been funded to improve healthcare coverage such as vaccination, produce training for healthcare professionals or facilitate access to healthcare services, including mental health. Key projects include: 

* ### EU4Health & WHO/IOM Joint Project for Ukrainian Refugees (2023–2025): Funded with €4 million under the EU4Health programme, this project supports refugees and displaced persons from Ukraine in ten EU countries. Implemented in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the initiative aims to strengthen national health systems and improve access to healthcare services for those under temporary protection.

* ### Well-U Project \- Mental Health Support for Ukrainian Children: Operating in Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Romania, the Well-U project focuses on promoting the mental health and psychosocial well-being of Ukrainian refugee children and their caregivers. It employs preventive interventions delivered by local NGOs, educators, cultural mediators, and peer refugees, utilizing programs such as ReachNow, TeamUp, MGSC, and PM+.

* ### EU-MiCare: \-Training for Mental Health Professionals: The EU-MiCare project aims to enhance the capacity of mental health professionals working with migrants and refugees.It offers interdisciplinary training modules to improve understanding of mental health issues specific to these populations, fostering culturally sensitive and comprehensive care.

* ### HIV and STI Outreach Projects for Migrants: Under the EU Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion (2021–2027), the EU invested €6.64 million in five projects—EXPAND, TOGETHERHIVSTI, REACH-OUT, CORE, and BOOST—to provide community-based healthcare and outreach services targeting HIV and AIDS among hard-to-reach populations, especially migrants

* ### MyHealth Project \- Improving Access for Vulnerable Migrants: Coordinated by the Vall d'Hebron Research Institute in Barcelona, the MyHealth project focuses on improving healthcare access for vulnerable immigrants, particularly women and unaccompanied minors. It addresses mental disorders, infectious diseases, and chronic non-transmissible conditions prevalent among newly arrived migrants.

* ### Train4M\&H – Training for Migrants and Health: This initiative was launched by the European Commission under the Third Health Programme (2014–2020).and carried out by a consortium of European partners. It aimed to develop and deliver training resources for various professional groups working with migrants and refugees. 

Looking at recent EU projects, Ukrainian refugees, mental health, community-based interventions, heightened vulnerability and training of healthcare professionals have been recurring themes. 

A literature review conducted by Riza et al (2020) has found that good communication, linguistic barriers and cultural differences play crucial roles in the effective application of community-based interventions. Advocating for community-based healthcare as a valuable strategy to reduce health inequalities and improve newcomers’ integration in the EU, they found that partnerships between governments and community providers, tailor-made educational activities for children, linguistically and culturally adapted disease prevention activities, community and school-based interventions for mental health and training programs for future healthcare professionals are efficient and reproducible ways to improve the health newcomers.

Another study by Chiarenza and his colleagues (2019) examined newcomers’ (barriers to) healthcare access. They found a range of challenges impacting accessibility, including legislative, financial and administrative barriers, and lack of interpretation and cultural mediation services, reliable information on history of migrant patients, knowledge of available services, organisation and coordination between services. They argued that interventions responding to emergencies only are often fragmented and chaotic, calling for further attention to structural changes in the EU health systems.

Past AMIF-funded healthcare initiatives

AMIF has supported, often as co-funder, several healthcare-related interventions aimed at improving access to medical and mental health services for migrants and asylum seekers across Europe. These include: 

* MHEALTH4ALL: This transnational project, launched following the 2020 AMIF Union Actions call, focuses on developing an evidence-based, multilingual digital platform to assist healthcare providers in delivering mental health services to migrants with limited language skills. It is part of the EU’s broader Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion 2021–2027.   
* Mount Carmel Hospital, Malta: In Malta, AMIF co-funded a €2.99 million initiative to enhance mental health services for asylum seekers and refugees. The project aimed to provide comprehensive care for individuals who experienced severe trauma, ensuring timely treatment and better integration into society.   
* Fostering Integration by Addressing Health Equity – Phase II (Portugal): Implemented by IOM Portugal starting in 2020, this project aimed to ensure more equitable healthcare for the migrant population by addressing systemic barriers to access and promoting health equity.   
* UK AMIF Projects: Up to December 2023, the UK allocated over £500 million to 119 projects under AMIF, with several focusing on healthcare access for migrants. These projects included initiatives to prevent destitution by facilitating access to statutory financial support and accommodation for eligible adult asylum seekers.

Key areas targeted in previous AMIF-funded projects include (digital) information dissemination, mental health, and systematic challenges faced by newcomers.   
While these projects have addressed healthcare-related needs as part of broader integration or support initiatives, the 2025 Call is the first instance where healthcare access is the sole focus of a dedicated funding topic. This development reflects the Commission's recognition of healthcare as a critical component of migrant integration and inclusion.

State level & civil society interventions 

While the EU sets minimum standards on displaced persons’ access to healthcare, specific policies remain for Member State discretion. For this reason, it is worth considering state-level interventions, often advanced through civil society organisations. 

*Greece*

Greece has implemented a range of healthcare interventions targeting newcomers, involving government initiatives, international NGOs, and local organisations. These include: 

* PHILOS Programme (EODY – National Public Health Organization): The PHILOS programme was designed to provide comprehensive health services to refugees and migrants across mainland Greece, enhancing the capacity of the National Health System to meet increased demands. It focused on disease prevention and upholding the human right to health. The programme received an extension until March 15, 2024, funded by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) 2021–2027. Subsequently, it was scheduled to be replaced by a new initiative named "IPOCRATES," aimed at continuing health services in accommodation facilities under the Reception and Identification Service.  
* Global Brigades – Medical Brigades in Greece: This program involves international volunteers working alongside local doctors in Athens to provide primary health care for asylum seekers. Activities include patient intake, health education workshops, and referrals to specialists.  
* INGOs implementing related projects/ support services:  
  * MSF   
  * HIAS (mental health)  
  * IRC (mental health)

Research conducted on healthcare provision for newcomers’ in Greece by Kotsouradi et al (2019) focused on the notion of cultural competence. They argued that cultural competence in the refugee context requires rethinking, integrating relevant components to enhance the provision of equal treatment and ultimately end perceived or existing discrimination. 

An area addressed in multiple studies is mental health. Research has highlighted the heightened risk of newcomers to psychological and psychiatric issues, and lack proper support despite the existence of available services due to unequal service distribution, lack of coordination and cultural factors (Μπαμπλέκη, 2023\). A study published in 2023 emphasised the crucial role of NGOs in bridging gaps in mental healthcare, and the need to enhance cultural competence among professionals, including language barriers (Μπαμπλέκη, 2023\). 

Generally, literature has highlighted the unique challenges that the Greek healthcare system is facing due, being under significant financial pressure and as a first country of arrival (Cohen & Pineiro, 2021). For these reasons, civil society has had a predominant role providing primary healthcare services, with referrals into the Greek health system for specialist care and investigations.

*Italy* 

Italy shares similar challenges as those faced by Greece. Asylum seekers residing in governmental reception centers, such as Centri di Accoglienza Straordinaria (CAS) and Centri di Primo Arrivo (CPA), receive medical support in accessing the national healthcare system. These centers provide initial health screenings, ongoing medical care, and cultural mediation services to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and residents. Additional programmes and services are provided by INGOs, notably WHO, IRC and MSF.

A study of national guidelines providing evidence-based recommendations on health assessments for migrants and asylum seekers upon their arrival in Italy has found that it is important to periodically  update guidelines, to support economic sustainability and prevent stigmatisation (Tosti et al, 2021). A separate study by Figura and colleagues (2024) was concerned with the overall health of newcomers in Italy, focusing on reception and integration. They found that territorial barriers, lack of social network, and specific professionals' training constitute major healthcare delivery obstacles. For migrants, language improvement emerged as key, whereas a lack of relationship with migrants was highlighted by locals.  They argue that a welcoming project with solid leadership and adequate resources can be crucial in mediating health promotion and integration, and highlighting that the involvement of the resident population is essential.

The 2025 AMIF call highlights how Member States have made efforts to improve the availability of country-specific information to migrants on their right to access healthcare, via the use of web portals in multiple languages and booklets but more efforts are still needed. 

**Impact assessments**   
*What are the factors that explain outcomes?*

Key shortcomings of healthcare interventions in the EU include: 

1\. Awareness and Outreach Strategies (Riza et al, 2020; Chiarenza et al, 2019): limited awareness of healthcare rights and services among migrants— access rights alone is insufficient. The *effectiveness of outreach* (targeted communication, cultural mediation, multilingual materials) heavily influences migrants’ ability to access care.

2\. Cultural Competency and Trust in Health Systems (Kotsouradi et al, 2019; Μπαμπλέκη, 2023): Lack of trust and understanding due to cultural gaps between providers and migrant communities. *Culturally competent care*, including the use of interpreters and training for professionals, is essential for improving access and quality of care.

3\. Mental Health and Trauma-Informed Services (European Commission, n.d.): High incidence of trauma and psychological distress among migrants with limited service use. Interventions that are *trauma-informed*, community-based, and stigma-sensitive achieve better outcomes. For example, the *Well-U Project* and *EU-MiCare* showed promising results using community-based and peer-led models.

4\. Gender- and Age-Sensitive Services (European Commission, n.d.): Women and unaccompanied minors face specific vulnerabilities and often fall through policy cracks. *Intersectional design*—addressing gender, age, and trauma simultaneously—enhances impact. MyHealth and AMIF projects tailored to women and minors underscore the importance of specificity in intervention design.

5\. Integration with Digital and Community Networks: Digital exclusion and lack of trusted intermediaries limit access to information and services. *Digital inclusion* and partnerships with community leaders improve outreach and system navigation.  
This is addressed in MHEALTH4ALL and AMIF’s digital platform project.

6\. Structural and Policy Constraints (Farina et al, 2024; Bozorgmehr et al, 2023): Uneven implementation of EU health directives and inadequate health data systems. *Policy coherence,  adequate implementation,* and *health system integration* determine long-term success. Further, fragmented EU policies compromise care quality and cost-effectiveness. This includes the need for better data collection and migrant participation in health governance.

7\. Coordination Between Stakeholders: Fragmentation between emergency response, NGOs, and national systems. *Multi-level collaboration*—across government, civil society, and international agencies—produces more sustainable results. The PHILOS Program in Greece and Italian regional coordination illustrate both the potential and limitations of multi-actor frameworks.

8\. Evaluation and Learning from Past Interventions: Short project cycles and lack of scaling for successful pilots. *Evidence-based scaling* of proven practices and continued evaluation ensure cost-effectiveness and relevance. The new AMIF 2025 call builds directly on lessons from past mixed-focus projects, with a new emphasis on healthcare as a stand-alone priority.

**Recommendations** 

1. Prioritise Targeted Awareness and Outreach Campaigns  
* Develop multilingual communication materials.  
* Use community-based channels, including trusted intermediaries, and peer networks.  
* Move beyond passive information provision to proactive outreach—especially for high-risk groups like unaccompanied minors and women.  
2. Strengthen Tailored Support in Health Systems  
* Provide mandatory training for healthcare professionals on intercultural communication and trauma-informed care.  
* Institutionalize the use of interpreters and cultural mediators in all frontline services.  
* Foster relationships of trust between health providers and migrant communities through consistent, respectful engagement.  
3. Emphasise Adequate Mental Health Support   
* Design services that are community-based, non-stigmatizing, and trauma-aware.  
* Incorporate preventive mental health measures within reception and integration frameworks.  
4. Design Intersectional, Gender- and Age-Sensitive Services  
* Ensure tailored services for women, youth, and unaccompanied minors—particularly in sexual and reproductive health.  
5. Improve Digital and Community-Based Access  
* Expand digital inclusion efforts, including access to mobile platforms, digital literacy training, and multilingual online resources.  
* Ensure digital solutions are paired with on-the-ground community outreach.  
6. Address Structural and Policy Implementation Gaps  
* Advocate for full and coherent implementation of EU directives across Member States.  
* Improve data systems to include comprehensive migrant health data, ensuring privacy and community engagement.  
* Promote migrant participation in policy and system design to increase legitimacy and responsiveness.  
7. Foster Multi-Level and Cross-Sector Collaboration  
* Establish coordination mechanisms among national authorities, NGOs, international organizations, and civil society.  
* Ensure emergency interventions are integrated with long-term health system planning.  
8. Ensure Evaluation, Learning, and Scaling of Proven Practices  
* Build evaluation and learning frameworks into every intervention from the outset.  
* Create pathways for successful pilot projects to scale, both within and across Member States.
