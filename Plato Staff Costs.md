Of course. Based on the "APPLICATION GUIDELINES" document for the PLATO programme, here is a comprehensive breakdown of all information related to 'staff costs'.

The document categorizes costs for personnel into two main types under the "Direct Costs" section.

### A. Personnel Costs (Section 11.3.1)

This is the primary section detailing how to budget for staff.

#### **A.1 Cost for Employees**
This category is for personnel working for the lead applicant or partner under a standard employment contract.

*   **Eligibility Conditions:**
    *   Costs must be for personnel working for the applicant/partner under an employment contract (or an equivalent act).
    *   The work must be directly linked to the project's activities.
*   **What's Included:**
    *   Salaries
    *   Social security contributions
    *   Taxes
    *   Other costs linked to remuneration as required by national law or the employment contract.
*   **How to Calculate and Budget:**
    *   You must declare the **total monthly payroll cost** (including all contributions and taxes), the **duration of employment** in months for the activity, and the **employment rate** (the percentage of their working time dedicated to that specific activity).
*   **Official Example Provided:**
    *   If an employee has a total monthly payroll cost of €1,800, works on an activity for 6 months, and allocates 40% of their time to it, the budget calculation is:
        **€1,800 x 6 months x 40% = €4,320**

#### **A.2 Costs for Natural Persons**
This category is for individuals who work on the project under a direct contract that is *not* a standard employment contract (e.g., a service or project contract), or for individuals seconded from another organization.

*   **Eligibility Conditions:**
    *   The person must work under conditions similar to a regular employee (regarding how work is organized, tasks performed, etc.).
    *   The results of the work must belong to the lead applicant or partner.
    *   The cost must be based on the actual rate for the contract and not be significantly different from what an employee in a similar role would cost.
*   **Important Exclusion:** This category **cannot** include costs for consultants that are legal entities. Those costs must be budgeted under "B2. Other Expenses".

### B. Related Costs and Considerations

Beyond the direct payroll, other costs and evaluation criteria are directly linked to staff.

#### **1. Travel Costs of Project Staff (Section B1 & Annex 1)**
Expenses for staff travel are eligible but must be calculated according to specific rules.

*   **What's Included:** Transportation, accommodation, meals, and other related travel expenses for **employees and natural persons** involved in the project.
*   **Travel within Greece (Annex 1):**
    *   **Land travel (private car):** €0.25 per kilometer.
    *   **Accommodation:** €112 per night.
    *   **Subsistence (meals, local transport):** €82 per day.
    *   **Air Travel:** Maximum round-trip airfare within Greece is €340.
*   **Travel within the Republic of Cyprus (Annex 1):**
    *   **Land travel (private car):** €0.36 per kilometer.
    *   **Accommodation:** €140 per night.
    *   **Subsistence (meals, local transport):** €88 per day.
*   **Travel within other EU Member States:** Costs are calculated based on distance bands as per EU Decision C (2024) 5405.

#### **2. Ineligible Staff-Related Costs (Section 11.3.3)**
*   The document specifies that costs for staff of a national, regional, or local administration are ineligible if the activities are part of the normal duties of that administration.

#### **3. Evaluation of Staff Costs (Section 14.3)**
*   The budget you submit, including all personnel costs, will be assessed under the evaluation criterion **"Value for money (based on submitted project budget)"**, which has a maximum score of 20 points. This means the proposed staff costs must be reasonable and justified for the work being done.
